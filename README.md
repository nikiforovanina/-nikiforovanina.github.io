Hey, thanks for a visit! I'm a third year PhD student in Economics at Bocconi Univerisity. 

I am interested in topics spanning the literature of political economy and public economics, as well as in IO estimation techniques. In my research I explore patterns of behaviour of agents in different settings ranging from voting in elections to choosing a college. Before starting my PhD I earned MA in economics from New Economic School in Moscow and BSc and MSc in Geography from Moscow State Univerisy.
