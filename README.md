Hey,  I'm a second year PhD Econ student at Bocconi Univerisity. I am interested in topics spanning the literature of political economy and political science, such as authoritarianism, collective actions problems, collective memory and others. Before starting my PhD I earned MA in economics from New Economic School in Moscow and BSc and MSc in Geography from Moscow State Univerisy.
