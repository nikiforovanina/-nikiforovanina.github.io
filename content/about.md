Hey,  I'm a second year PhD Econ student at Bocconi Univerisity. 

I am interested in topics spanning the literature of political economy and political science, such as authoritarianism, collective actions problems, voting, collective memory and others. I am fascinated by the countries of Eastern Europe and Russia and working on projects about them.  

Before starting my PhD I earned MA in Economics from New Economic School in Moscow and BSc and MSc in Geography from Moscow State Univerisy.
