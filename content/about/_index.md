about me
---

Hey,  I'm a third year PhD Econ student at Bocconi Univerisity. 

I am interested in topics spanning the literature of political economy and political science, such as authoritarianism, collective actions problems, voting, collective memory and others. In my research I am mostly focusing on the countries of Eastern Europe and Russia.  

Before starting my PhD I earned MA in Economics from New Economic School in Moscow and BSc and MSc in Geography from Moscow State Univerisy.
